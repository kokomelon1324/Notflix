                <h3>How do you compute the numbers used in the ISP Speed Index?</h3>
                <h4>Speed Index ratings reflect the average performance during prime time (three busiest hours in the local region). The average is well below the peak performance due to many factors including the variety of encodes we use to deliver the TV shows and movies we carry as well as home Wi-Fi and the variety of devices our members use. Those factors cancel out when comparing across ISPs, so these relative rankings are a good indicator of the consistent performance typically experienced across all users on an ISP network.</h4>

                <h4>Netflix clients interact with multiple network destinations to request and deliver content to members. ISPs should contact their Open Connect Partner Engagement Manager (PEM) for assistance with network activities.</h4>
